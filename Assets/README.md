### Color Palette

The color palette was carefully chosen to evoke a sense of elegance, tranquility, and luxury. Primary colors include shades of blue-green, leaning towards a more natural green, complemented by a golden hue inspired by the palace in the hero image. A contrasting coral red, reminiscent of marine life, and a soft sand-toned background complete the aesthetic.

### Typography

The selected fonts enhance the website’s luxurious and calming feel. **Merriweather** is used for titles, providing a classic and timeless appeal, while **Montserrat** serves as the main text font, chosen for its clean and neutral character. This combination ensures a professional and high-end impression, aligned with the retreat’s branding.

## Development & Functionality

### Homepage Features

The homepage includes a **carousel display** that allows users to browse through the various exclusive package options offered by the hotel. This interactive element is designed for both mobile and tablet views, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

### Booking Process

Under the **Book Now** section, the system dynamically displays availability status based on user selections:

-  If the selected room is **available**, a message appears: _"Great! Your desired room is available – click Continue to complete your booking."_
-  If the room is **unavailable**, an alternative message suggests: _"Unfortunately, your selected package is not available on these dates. Please try another date."_

Depending on the chosen payment method, the interface will display **different payment options**, such as PayPal or credit card. Upon confirming the booking, a confirmation message will be shown.

### Interactive Elements

-  **Hover Effects:** Links increase in text size on hover, improving user feedback and accessibility.
-  **Design System:** All text styles and color themes are stored as reusable styles in Figma, ensuring consistency across components.
-  **Prototype Functionality:** The **mobile design prototype** demonstrates how buttons and links behave dynamically within the interface.

### Development Guidelines

All relevant information regarding **breakpoints, text styles, colors, and margins** can be found under the "Design" page in the Figma file. These styles have been consistently applied across all components for a cohesive user experience.

A complete reference for all textual content is stored further down in this file.
